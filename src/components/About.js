                        From writing basic code in C++ when I was 13, to now being a web developer has been a great journey.
                        I am an Experienced developer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry,
                        skilled in Frontend web development , Management, and Media Outreach.
                        Strong operations professional with a Bachelor of Technology - BTech focused in Information Technology from Vellore Institute of Technology.
                        Intially I was into app dev, but it did not made me happy.
                        I learnt HTML for a curriculum course and my interest grew as I started working with javascript.
                        Now, I am learning ReactJS and paving my way in frontend web development.
                        I will definitely make my way into backend development very soon and grow as a full stack developer.
                        I am also into competitive programming, and love making my contributions in open-source. It is th best way to collaborate and learn.
                        Apart from this, I enjoy music and binge watching.
